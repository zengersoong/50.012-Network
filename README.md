Lab 2:Building your own web application with a Restful API

### List of task to fulfil for Lab
1. This lab we are tasked to write a simple web server using restful API
2. Server and client side have to be able to receive and send JSON datastructures respectively
3. Should contain at least 5 different API calls/ways to interact with your API
4. At least two nouns and different verbs(GET/PUT/DELETE)
5. Implement a simple HTTP authentication with a username and a password. - No Need to implement HTTPS/TLS YET


### My lab strategy is a set up a simple way for students to view their assigned student ID or username and 
A server-client web server for admins to access the MongoDB to make changes and alteration to the student ID/username using flask.  
*MongoDB + Python Flask + RESTFUL API*

# Directory/ Container Nouns
1. /student
2. /admin
3. /login

# Methods
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
5. NOTICE

5. alterationId(): -

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
admin`*__

6. delete_All(): -

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
admin`*__

7. delete_student(name):

__*`curl -X DELETE
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
admin/test`*__


8. notice():-
Just a simply notice
board showing things like
instruction  
__*`curl -X NOTICE
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
student`*__


### How to run?
1. Download python3
2. Get the libraries required such as `pip3 install flask` && `sudo pip3 install pymongo`
3. Open up two terminals, Command prompt on either Linux-based operating system / macOS
4. Run `python3 week2lab2.py` to start the server up.
5. On the other terminal run the respective curl commands.

Lab 3:Server and Client UDP 

### List of task to fulfil for Lab
1. The client should send approximately 1.5Mbps
2. No packets should be dropped by default
3. If we increase the packet rate by 10%, we should see dropped packets
4. The server should report if incoming traffic has dropped datagrams



### My lab strategy 
Absolutely no strategy , just send and wait to ensure that packets are sent at 1.5Mbps to server.
Json is used to keep track of segment IDs, a python list is kept to keep track of which segment are late/ dropped.

Lab 5: Designing and implementing a small network

1. Use knowledge from the class to design and implement a small network
2. Once again, we are using mininet to run a set of virtualized hosts
3. Your job is to connect these hosts correctly through switches and routers, and to configure
critical services
4. Changing DHCP configuration
5. Configuring DNS
6. Observing NAT
7. Creating a simple firewalling by setting up iptables
  1. Changing iptable routing
